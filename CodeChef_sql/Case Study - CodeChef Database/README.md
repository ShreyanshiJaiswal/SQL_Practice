# 📘 SQL Case Studies – CodeChef Database (Aggregate & Group By)

This folder contains my progress while practicing SQL case studies from the **CodeChef Database Track**, specifically the **Aggregate Functions & GROUP BY** section.

## ✔️ Progress  
- **47% Completed**  
- Solved **all non-Pro questions** available in this section.

## ✔️ Nature of Questions (Important Context)

Most of the problems in this group were **MCQ-based SQL questions**, where the task involved:

- Selecting the correct output of a query  
- Identifying mistakes in SQL statements  
- Choosing the valid/invalid query from given options  
- Understanding how aggregates behave with NULLs  
- Evaluating GROUP BY results mentally  
- Predicting nested aggregate outputs  

Because these were multiple-choice questions, the platform often **had full schema details** or **complete datasets**, but the dataset & tables were available and the **actual question and answer options were in a separate tab**, requiring:

- Switching between the data tab and question tab  
- Interpreting the query mentally  
- Matching the answer from the multiple choices  

Because these were not traditional “write-the-query” exercises, documenting them in a typical SQL format for GitHub was less straightforward and more time-consuming.  

This also made it challenging to maintain GitHub uploads consistently, since MCQ-style SQL problems do not always translate into standalone SQL files or reproducible examples.

## ✔️ Questions Solved (Non-Pro Accessible)

The solved questions covered topics such as:
- Error identification in SQL  
- COUNT() and nested aggregates  
- Output prediction  
- Incorrect vs correct SQL statements  
- GROUP BY behavior  
- Aggregates with NULL handling

## 🔒 Questions Not Attempted (Pro-Locked)

Some questions in this section were available **only with a Pro subscription**, including approximately:
- **6 Easy**  
- **2 Medium**  
- **2 Hard**

Since the platform restricted access, these questions could not be solved or documented.

## 📝 Note on Upload Gap

Although I was actively solving all accessible questions, the MCQ format and Pro-locked content made documentation challenging. This contributed to a brief gap in GitHub activity despite consistent learning throughout the period.
